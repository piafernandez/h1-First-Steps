## Summary

- In this darknet diaries podcast, episode 124, the host Jack tells the story of how a hacker was able to bypass Facebook's security measures and how he gained access to internal information about the company's operations.

- The hacker was Evaldas Rimasauskas, a guy from Lithuania who wanted to scam Facebook for a lot of money.
- How did he managed to do this ? They have used social engineering tactics. He and his team collected information about Facebook's operations such as names of the contractors and amounts paid to them.  They have created fake invoices and sent them to Facebook from a legitimate-looking email address from on of Facebook's contractors, Quantum Computers.
  - What is social engineering ? it's the use of psychological manipulation to trick people into divulging sensitive information. In this case, it involves impersonating someone.
- The hackers were able to trick Facebook into paying these fake invoices and were able to steal million of dollars. They have also managed to scam Google.
- Facebook and Google eventually discovered the scam and worked with the FBI to have  Evaldas arrested.
- This story shows the importance of taking protective measures against cyber attacks.
  - For example, companies should train their employees to be able to recognize phishing.

> A question I have for this episode is why did it take that much time before Quanta Computers realised that they weren't getting paid ?
